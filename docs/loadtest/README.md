# Loadtest

This version of the load tester can test subscription `v1alpha2` only. For `v1alpha1` we have a [legacy branch](https://github.com/kyma-project/eventing-tools/tree/loadtest-subscription-v1alpha1).
This tool is used to generate continues load on the Eventing components.
It does that by sending Cloudevents to the Eventing publisher proxy forever and consume them inside Kyma functions.
Ideally, it should be used when JetStream is used as the active Eventing backend.

## Eventing infrastructure

For testing against **Legacy Events** set `use_legacy events` to `true`. Leave it to `false` to test against **Cloud Events**.

The load test will create:

1. **Two** Kyma function subscribers.
2. **Two** Kyma subscriptions.

| Namespace      | Subscription   | Subscriber            |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| eventing-test  | subscription-0 | loadtest-subscriber-0 |
| eventing-test  | subscription-1 | loadtest-subscriber-1 |

> Note: Each Kyma subscription is configured with `N` unique event types.

## Event types naming conventions

1. **There are two event names**:
    - The `subscription-0` has `order.created`.
    - The `subscription-1` has `order.updated`.

2. **Events carry the `eps` information**:
 - EPS **50**: `order.created.v0050`.
 - EPS **90**: `order.created.v0090

*Cloud Events* have the `eps` encoded at the end as part of the `version`.
*Legacy Events* have the `eps`  body in the `event-type` field of the body.

> Note: Encoding the EPS in the event type version is used only for debugging purposes and is not a production use-case.

## Usage

### Deploy

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-deploy
   ```

### Change the loadtest behaviour at runtime:

1. Update the loadtest ConfigMap values:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit cm -n eventing-test loadtest
   ```

   > Note: After updating the loadtest-publisher  ConfigMap, its behaviour will change
   > automatically at runtime without the need to restart it.

### Stop

This is useful in case we want to stop sending events to the Eventing publisher proxy, but preserve the Eventing
infrastructure inside the `eventing-test` namespace.

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-stop
   ```

   > Note: To continue sending events, deploy the loadtest again.

### Logs

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Loadtest logs:
   ```bash
   stern -n eventing-test loadtest -c loadtest --since 1s
   ```
3. Subscriber logs:
   ```bash
   stern -n eventing-test sink -c function --since 1s | grep type
   ```

### Cleanup

1. Connect to a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   make loadtest-delete
   ```

## Future enhancements

- Generate subscriptions in a more generic way. Instead of creating only `2` subscriptions, create `N` subscriptions.
- Implement a graceful shutdown to delete Kyma subscriptions in the `eventing-test` namespace when the loadtest receives a
  termination signal.
