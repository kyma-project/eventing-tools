# This is a reusable workflow to bump the 'sec-scanners-config.yaml'
#
# It will do so by using the script `hack/scripts/render-sec-scanners-config.sh`, that is not part of the workflow.
# If you want to run this workflow against a repo the script must exist in that repo. This is by design, because every repo
# will require a specfic sec-scanners-config.yaml.
#
# The script `render-sec-scanners-config.sh` will in all cases require a version that is used to tag the corresponding image
# of the controller. For this reason, passing the input `VERSION` is required.
#
# To create a PR and monitor it, this workflow will require a classic github personal access token (pat) passed
# as a secret named `BOT_PAT`. The token must be configured to have all rights for `repo`, `user` and `workflow`.
# Further reads:
#   Setting a secret for a repo: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions
#
# If changes were done by the script, the workflow will create a PR and wait for it to be merged.
# It has a default value of 3600 (seconds (= 1 hour)). Note that GitHub Action jobs will automatically fail after 6 hours:
# Further reads:
#   Default limits for GitHub Actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits
# The waiting will happen with a timeout that can be set via the input of `TIMEOUT`. The units are seconds.
#
# Examples of using this workflow:
#  1. Set all awailable inputs and secrets.
